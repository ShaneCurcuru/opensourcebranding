## What Is Open Source?

Software that is publicly available that uses an [OSI listed open source license](https://tldrfoss.com).

## What are trademarks?

A trademark is a name, symbol, logo, or sound that identifies the source of a product in the minds of a consumer.

## Do open source projects need trademarks?

Yes!  While open source code is free to fork, the name, branding, and reputation of a project or community is not free to fork.  Treating your project or product name as a trademark helps ensure that the reputation you've built with users stays with your project, not some fork.
